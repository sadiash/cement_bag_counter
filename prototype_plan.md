# Cement Bag Detection and Counting Prototype Plan

## 1. Technical Approach Overview

### Detection Strategy
We'll implement a hybrid approach combining:
- **Background subtraction**: To isolate moving objects from the static conveyor belt background
- **Object detection**: Using pre-trained models that can be adapted to cement bag detection
- **Contour analysis**: As a fallback method for simpler scenarios with good contrast

### Tracking Strategy
- **SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)**: Lightweight algorithm suitable for tracking objects across frames
- **Kalman filtering**: To predict object positions during occlusions or detection failures
- **Hungarian algorithm**: For optimal assignment between detections and existing tracks

### Counting Mechanism
- **Virtual line crossing**: Define a counting line in the frame
- **Direction-aware counting**: Track objects crossing the line in the direction of conveyor movement
- **Debouncing logic**: Prevent double-counting of the same bag

## 2. Implementation Components

### Core Components
1. **Video Input/Output Handler**
   - Read video frames
   - Process frames sequentially
   - Write output video with visualizations

2. **Background Subtraction Module**
   - Implement adaptive background modeling
   - Handle lighting variations
   - Filter noise and shadows

3. **Object Detection Module**
   - Option 1: Use pre-trained YOLO model
   - Option 2: Implement contour-based detection
   - Provide configuration for detection thresholds

4. **Object Tracking Module**
   - Implement SORT algorithm
   - Maintain object IDs across frames
   - Handle conveyor speed variations

5. **Counting Module**
   - Define virtual counting line/zone
   - Track object crossings
   - Maintain running count

6. **Visualization Module**
   - Draw bounding boxes around detected bags
   - Display tracking IDs
   - Show counting line and current count
   - Visualize detection confidence

## 3. Algorithm Selection

### Detection Options
- **Primary**: OpenCV's background subtraction (MOG2/KNN)
- **Secondary**: Pre-trained YOLOv5/YOLOv8 model (if needed for robustness)

### Tracking Algorithm
- **SORT**: Efficient tracking using Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm
- Fallback to simpler centroid tracking if SORT is too resource-intensive

### Performance Considerations
- Balance between accuracy and processing speed
- Optimize for real-time or near-real-time performance
- Provide configuration options for different hardware capabilities

## 4. Robustness Features

- **Adaptive thresholding**: To handle lighting variations
- **Morphological operations**: To clean up detection masks
- **Temporal consistency checks**: To filter out false detections
- **Belt speed estimation**: To adapt tracking parameters
- **Configurable ROI**: To focus processing on relevant areas

## 5. Limitations and Future Improvements

### Prototype Limitations
- Limited training data for specialized detection
- May struggle with extreme lighting conditions
- Not optimized for production-level performance

### Future Improvements
- Fine-tune object detection model with domain-specific data
- Implement deep learning-based tracking (DeepSORT)
